# Task-Manager


A task manager page built with only html and JavaScript. This stores the data locally and the data stays locally and does not get deleted until the user manually deletes it. You can add n number of tasks and clear all at once. The UI is done with the materialize cdn. Few aspects are done with the help JQuery cdn.
